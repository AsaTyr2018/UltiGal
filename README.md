**Ultimate Gallery - PHP Web Application**

This is the GitHub repository for the "Ultimate Gallery" PHP web application. This application allows you to create a beautiful image gallery with categorization, filtering, and a user-friendly interface.

**Key Features:**

1. **Categorization:** Organize your images into categories and artists. Each category can have multiple artists, and each artist can have multiple images.

2. **Filtering:** Users can filter images by category, artist, date, and search term to find exactly what they're looking for.

3. **Alphabetical Navigation:** A handy alphabetical filter bar allows users to jump to categories starting with a specific letter.

4. **Image Viewer:** The application includes a built-in image viewer with Lightbox integration, enabling users to view images in a gallery format with resizing and navigation options.

**Folder Structure:**

The script assumes a specific folder structure for your images:

```
./images/
    Category1/
        Artist1/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
        Artist2/
            image3.jpg
    Category2/
        Artist3/
            image4.jpg
```

You can customize the categories, artists, and images to suit your needs.

**How to Use:**

1. Upload your images into the './images/' directory, organizing them into categories and artists as desired.

2. Access the application through a web browser, and you'll see the gallery view with categories listed alphabetically.

3. Click on a category to explore artists within that category and view random images from each artist.

4. Use the filtering options to refine your image selection based on category, artist, date, or search terms.

5. Enjoy a user-friendly image viewing experience with Lightbox.

**Note:**

- Make sure to configure your web server to run PHP scripts.

- Customize the appearance and behavior by editing the CSS and JavaScript as needed.

Feel free to clone this repository and adapt the PHP script to create your own stunning image gallery with easy categorization and filtering!
